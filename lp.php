      <h2>What are Mud Crabs?</h2>
      <p> The mangroves and estuaries of Asia, Australia, and Africa are home to a kind of crab known as the mud crab. It is also known as Scylla serrata, Mangrove Crab, Black Crab, Serrated Swimming Crab, Giant Mud Crab, Indo-Pacific Swamp Crab, Edible Mud Crab, etc. Their shell colors range from a rich, mottled green to a very dark brown in their most prevalent varieties. In its natural habitat, the mud crab is a species that is very significant economically. Traps, trawling, hooking, baited wire mesh pots, and hand harvesting are the main methods used to capture it. They have great demand on the market, high flesh content, rapid growth rate in captivity, are mainly used for food, usually sold alive, and represent the most prevalent crab species in many marketplaces of Southeast Asia. They are also highly hardy crabs that can tolerate most water conditions, were sold at very alarming prevalence in global markets, and commercial aquaculture is becoming more and more popular day after day.
